# Lane Runner
Group 6 (PAG6) project assignment in TDT4240 Software Architecture at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Lane Runner is a sidescrolling endless runner, with a twist. At all times, two different layers are available, and the player may jump between them by swiping up or down. This is necessary to avoid hindrances and obstacles on one lane.

## Devices

* Android

This application is developed using the libGDX framework, and because of that it can easily be ported to other platforms:
